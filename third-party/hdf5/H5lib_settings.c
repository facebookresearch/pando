 * Usually, H5libhdf5_settings is a big multiline string containing human readable information about
 * the environment and config at compile time. In the normal build, it's generated by
 * H5make_libsettings.c, which just reformats libhdf5.settings, which itself is generated by either
 * CMake or autotools.
