    TimeSeries represents time series data (duh), with core properties
    `TimeSeries.timestamps` and `TimeSeries.channel_data`.

    A useful mental model is to think about this object as a 2D array, with
    rows increasing in time. The first column is the `timestamps`, and the
    other columns are different channels. This representation can be accessed
    through the `TimeSeries.time_series` property/method.

    `TimeSeries` enforces the invariant that time must increase monotonically,
    and the timestamps and channel_data must have the same number of time points.
    Setting either `timestamps` or `channel_data` property that violates this
    will result in errors.

    `TimeSeries` supports setting and selecting data for given time
    points (`select_time`), channels (`select_channels`), or combination of
    both (`select_channel_data_at_time`), with syntax similar to
    numpy array basic indexing.
    (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.indexing.html#basics-indexing)

    Slicing syntax can be achieved with the help of `array_utils.SliceMaker` class.

    Specifically, `select_time` can be thought of as selecting rows,
    `select_channels` can be thought of as seleting columns of the `channel_data`,
    therefore 1D numpy array indexing applies.

    Functions can be applied to `channel_data` (`transform_channel_data`), the returned
    type (`TimeSeries` or numpy array) will differ depending on the type of transformation.
